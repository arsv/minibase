Virtual Terminal MUltipleXer allows running several processes willing to
access /dev/input devices and/or become KMS masters concurrently by proxying
their access to those devices, and multiplexing data streams in order to
implement conventional VT switching.

Or in other words, vtmux is needed to run one wayland compositor on tty1,
another one on tty2, and a regular text mode console on tty3, Xorg on tty4,
and still have C-A-Fn VT switching work as expected.

On the basic level, vtmux is a special-purpose supervisor that spawns
top-level VC/DRM clients (Xorg, Wayland compositors and so on). In a properly
configured system, vtmux should be the only process with non-mediated access
to DRM/input devices. Any Xorg server, Wayland compositors and so on must
be running under vtmux.


Historical background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Long time ago, Linux had a singular unitary "console" provided by BIOS,
which had text output and keyboard input, aka a TTY. It was a part of the
PC platform Linux was running on. Linux had a notion of virtual consoles,
multiple emulated TTYs implemented atop of this BIOS-provided one.
C-A-Fn keys were used to switch between the emulated TTYs, making one of
them active.

Fast forward to current year. Lots of things have changed. Linux does not
rely on BIOS anymore, in fact it runs on platforms that do not and never
had anything resembling BIOS. Linux now has input subsystem, which provides
input devices (plural; often 10 to 20 of them in a single PC), some of which
may be keyboards. Linux also has the DRM, the Direct Rendering Manager,
which manages graphical output devices (plural), which in turn can have
multiple hot-pluggable connectors (plural) for actual monitors to be
attached to. There is no inherent relation between the input subsystem
and the DRM. No notion of a singular TTY. No "monitor+keyboard" abstraction,
but a bunch of mutually unrelated keyboards and monitors.

Yet users still expect C-A-Fn to work the same way it did with BIOS.

To make it kinda sorta work, Linux includes a kernel-mode terminal emulator
to replace the missing BIOS code, and a bunch of awful, awful interfaces to
switch (multiplex) arbitrary set of input and output devices between several
applications running simultaneously, so that the whole contraption could
work in a way that resembles the old BIOS virtual console switching.


Mode of operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With respect to DRM and input devices, the kernel only defines the interface
to switch them, not the policy. It is up to the userspace to define which
clients get access to which devices, and how the switch happens.

The policy implemented in this particular tools is this: at most one DRM
client can be active at a time; the active DRM client is given access to
(and assumed to actually use) all of DRM and input devices.

This policy is simple to implement, and good enough for instance to try
a new Wayland compositor while keeping the primary Xorg session running
in background, or to let the user check several DEs by simply switching
between them with C-A-Fn. It may also fit certain use cases where
complete focus switch is desirable, like for instance doing work on one
tty and keeping entertainment in another.

There is no explicit support for splitting devices between several DRM
clients, like for instance having Xorg on one monitor and Wayland on another
monitor active at the same time. Doing that would require either a dedicated
tool similar to but still distinct from vtmux, or some creative use of Linux
containers, with several copies of vtmux running in each of them.


Technical background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Linux is not very well suited for proxying device access in userspace.
A process cannot listen(2) on a device node and accept(2) connections.
Even if it were possible (think FUSE), multiple context switches would
occur exactly where they should not: in latency-sensitive input code,
and potentially very fast frame-flipping code.

Instead, the client processes get actual open device fds and communicate
directly with the kernel.

Opening a device file from userspace makes the kernel allocate its internal
file-block structure. Re-opening the same device allocates another block, but
dup(2)ing a fd does not: the copy of the descriptor references the same shared
file-block structure, even if the fds end up in different processes.
Passing a fd through a unix domain socket is equivalent to duping it.

Both DRI and input devices have dedicated ioctls to "disable" the file-block
structure. Disabled inputs never become ready for reading and read nothing.
Disabled DRIs do not allow any output (kind of, see below on mastering).

The ioctls can be performed via any of the fds referring to the block, as long
as the calling process has enough privileges to do so. The block becomes
disabled for *all* fds referring to it. Disabling one block does not affect
other blocks referring to the same device.

Upon client request, vtmux opens the device and sends the fd over the socket.
The client gets a copy of the fd and uses it for device access. Vtmux keeps
its copy and uses it to disable the underlying file-block whenever the client
becomes inactive.


Notes on DRI masters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DRI devices (/dev/dri/cardN) handle both benign ops like GPU-accelerated
rendering to off-sreen buffers and privileged ops like modesetting (KMS),
video output configuration, frame buffer allocation, frame flipping.

Any process willing to use GPU must be able to open /dev/dri/cardN.
Only display servers should be able to do modesetting, and only one at a time.
And display servers are not supposed to have root privileges.

So the devices files themselves are not protected, and can be opened by almost
anyone. For each DRI device, at most one file-block at a time may be designated
a "master". Privileged ops may only be performed on a fd referring to
the master block. The process performing them does not need any additional
privileges, only a fd referring to the master block.

Setting or removing master status from a block requires root privileges and
a fd referring to the block. Multiplexer revokes master from inactive clients,
and sets it for client on the active VT. The clients themselves cannot change
their master status, but can do master-only ioctl when they are active.

Clients may get the master status suddenly revoked from underneath them and
must be ready to deal with unexpected EAGAINs from privileged ioctls.
VT switches are usually signalled, but signal delivery is inherently racy.

Clients that get the master status suddenly bestowed upon them must be prepared
to re-initialize the device, or at least check its configuration.


Input device revocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no such thing as input mastering. Inputs are single-purpose and
should not be readable for non-privileged processes.

Unlike DRIs, disabled input devices cannot be re-enabled. The reasons for this
are not clear at all. The clients are supposed to re-open all inputs each time
their VT becomes active.

Like with DRIs, disabling file-block requires root privileges.


VTs in KMS environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Display servers that use KMS and input devices do not really need VTs at all.
It's enough to have DRI and input multiplexing in place for them to work.
Once the process becomes DRI master, it can do anything with the video outputs,
and inputs are not affected by VT switching at all.

If all clients would use KMS and input, it would be possible to throw out
VT code from the kernel, remove VT_* ioctl from vtmux, and only do fd
multiplexing. This would also work well with kmscon. VT system, at this point,
is a kind of in-kernel KMS display manager providing services for non-KMS-aware
userspace clients, and does not belong in kernel space.

In a mixed environment, with clients that may still rely on VTs interfaces,
vtmux cannot tell for sure whether any given client is KMS-aware or not, so
it allocates a VT for all clients uniformly. VT switching in this case is
like engaging/disengaging this in-kernel display manager.

All clients also get their stdin, stdout and stderr redirected to respective
/dev/ttyN device, whether it makes sense or not. In KMS-only environment, it
would probably be better for vtmux to leave standard fds as is.


Why explicit keyboard input / VT_LOCKSWITCH?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
C-A-Fn key combos are usually handled within the kernel. During startup,
vtmux disables this in-kernel handling, and waits to be commanded a VT
switch via its control socket instead.

There are several reasons for this, the primary being that it makes the
switching code within vtmux somewhat saner. When the command comes from
within vtmux, the sequence is clear: disengage current client, switch VT,
engage new client. This would also work exactly the same way on a pure KMS
kernel with no VT support.

With the switching completely controlled by vtmux, we can also decide
whether we want to switch or not, effectively implementing disabled VTs.

Conventional method of doing the switch is reactive in nature and depends
heavily on the in-kernel VT subsystem. The kernel informs us that it wants
to switch, we disengage current client and report that to the kernel, the
kernel switches and informs up, we engage another client.


Greeter console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The idea behind greeter is similar to the C-A-Del window in MS Windows.
It's a dedicated client that the user can bring up on demand to perform
certain privileged operations. There's a stub implementation in this
directory called ctrlvt which implements shutdown/reboot/poweroff/sleep
and also password-protected lock.

# a better greeter should probably show which VTs have something running
# or bound to them, and possibly also some simplified equivalent of top
# with an option to kill offending processes.

Greeter is configured as pinned on non-existent tty0, but actually runs
on tty13 or above, to avoid conflicts with ttys accessible via C-A-Fn.
There is nothing special about it otherwise, just another DRM client.

Since it runs on a different VT, switching to greeter yanks DRM and input
from any other VTs, which means decent protection against eavesdropping
regardless of what runs on those other VTs.


Trying vtmux
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upon startup vtmux will lock VT switching, and may NOT unlock it in case
of abnormal exit. Make sure to have something like "sleep 30; ./unlock"
running somewhere, or at least some way to run it on request (maybe via
an ssh session).

Unlocking VTs while vtmux is running may interfere with its operation.
Switching VTs in a way that's not visible to vtmux (e.g. with C-A-Left
while in text mode, or with chvt(8)) will result in DRI/input devices being
engaged to a background VT.

Any switch performed by vtmux will lock VTs back again.

For any sort of debugging, run vtmux -n. This will prevent it from using
the tty is started on for any of the clients.
