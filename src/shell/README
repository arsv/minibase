Simple shell (interactive command interpreter) for use on the serial console.

Unlike conventional Unix/GNU shells, this thing is more of a "serial-port mc",
in that it can do things like listing directory contents without spawning
external tools.

There is no built-in line editing. This is by design. The proper place
for a line editor is on the other side of the wire, in the terminal application.
This shell expects a full command to arrive at once, or something close to that.

This shell might also be used as a pathfinder for clihub, at least until
something better comes along.


See ../../doc/shells.txt for more info on shells.
This one goes under "interactive shells" but it's not a general-purpose one.
