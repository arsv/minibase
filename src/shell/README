Simple interactive recovery shell.

This is meant to be primarily a fallback or a recovery shell for the system
console (especially if it's a serial console), not really for everyday use.
It might also serve as a pathfinder for the clihub environment, but clihub
should eventually get something better to run as the default shell.

Unlike conventional POSIX-style interactive shells, this thing works in the
"cooked mode" and does not have a prompt. The assumption here is that the line
editing happens on the terminal side, and the shell only gets to see the full
lines from the user, or something close to full lines. This should make it a
lot more usable on a serial console (ever tried working with a prompt while
the kernel keeps spewing messages at you?) and it also fits nicely with the
design ideas behind clihub. This approach also removes a lot of really nasty
code from the shell that doesn't really belong in a shell, basically the stuff
that GNU handles with its readline library.

# But it also means no tab completion, at least for now.

This shell is also the project's "line-oriented mc", in the sense that it
allows traversing the filesystem and performing simple file-related tasks
without the need to launch external tools.

See ../../doc/shells.txt for more info on shells.
This one goes under "interactive shells" but it's not a general-purpose one.
