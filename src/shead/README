Sheaders (shared library headers) are ELF .so libraries which export symbols
but do not contain any actual code for those symbols. These small stub ELFs
are meant to be used at link time as stand-ins for the complete loadable ELF
shared libraries, providing a description of library's interface to the static
linker without the bulk of the code which the static linker does not need.

Executables linked against sheaders should contain the right references and
be perfectly usable (loadable) with any ABI-compatible implementation of the
library.

In practical terms, the point of sheaders is to break dependency between
libfoo and libfoo-dev packages for a typical library. Building software
should be possible with only libfoo-dev around; libfoo itself should only
be needed to run it.


Sample workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Package libfoo:

    /usr/lib/libfoo-1.13.so

Package libfoo-dev:

    ./inc/foo.h       <-- header
    ./lib/libfoo.so   <-- sheader

On the build host, only libfoo-dev is unpacked into a temporary location:

    stat /path/to/projtools/lib/libfoo.so

    > File: /path/to/projtools/lib/libfoo.so
    > Size: 3582 ....

    target-gcc -o appexe ... -L /path/to/projtools/lib -lfoo

gcc calls ld, telling it to use the sheader:

    target-ld -o appexe ... /path/to/projtools/lib/libfoo.so ...

The sheader provides SONAME "libfoo-1.13.so" and the list of symbols
exported by libfoo-1.13.so, which ld uses to successfully link appexe:

    target-readelf -d appexe

    > ...
    > 0x00000001 (NEEDED) Shared library: [libfoo-1.13.so]
    > ...

The linked executable, `appexe`, can now be moved to the target host,
which only needs the `libfoo` package installed:

    stat /usr/lib/libfoo-1.13.so

    > File: /usr/lib/libfoo-1.13.so
    > Size: 5812496 ...

    ldd ./appexe

    >    ...
    >    libfoo-1.13.so => /usr/lib/libfoo-1.13.so
    >    ...

    ./appexe

    > Hello, world!


This is the wrong way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implementing sheaders as ELF shared objects is a deep compromise.

A much better approach would be declaring functions as being provided by
a particular shared library in regular headers, along with their prototypes.
The compiler would generate proper references to a particular library, and
the linker would not need to "resolve" them at all.

However, doing that would require deep changes to gcc/binutils, and more
importantly, re-thinking how shared libraries are treated within the GNU
system. Which is just not feasible.

ELF sheaders can be used with unmodified GNU tools, essentially adapting
them to a different workflow.

Consequently, sheaders are only meant to be as good as needed in order
to trick GNU tools into doing the right thing.


How exactly does it work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A sheader contains modified copies of DYNSYM and DYNSTR sections from the
parent library, with the bare minimum added on top to make the it usable.
Whenever possible, implementation details which do not affect linking are
removed.

  * Only symbols exported by the library are copied.
    (DYNSYM normally containts both imported and exported symbols)

  * Symbol values (addresses) are all set to 0.

  * Symbol sizes are all reset to either 0 or a certain default value.
    (GNU ld makes distinction between zero-sized and non-zero-sized symbols,
     but the exact size of the non-zero-sized symbols seems irrelevant)

  * Unnamed empty sections are used to transfer symbol-section flags
    (GNU ld does care what kind of section the symbol is in, also it makes
     nm and readelf output much better at basically no cost)

  * DYNAMIC section is added with a single entry, SONAME

Besides sections, a single segment is defined for the DYNAMIC section.
For some reason, GNU ld can only locate SONAME via program headers.

There are no other reasons to have any segments defined in sheaders.
