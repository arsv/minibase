This directory contains several tools meant for managing the root filesystem,
like locating the device, mounting it and so on. Some of these tools only make
sense within initrd.

The environment these get to run in is quite different from anything that runs
under a supervisor, and the task itself makes no sense in a system that's
already running, so these have been moved into their own directory.

Note these is not a complete set of tool for a viable initrd, just the stuff
that fits nowhere else. Typical initrd would likely use modprobe annd msh which
are normally a part of the regular system, and disk encryption tools which are
in their own directory.
