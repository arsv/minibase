This directory contains a couple of tools that work with packages in a custom
PAC format: mpac, which makes them, and mpkg, which deploys them into the
target filesystem. These are mostly meant to be used for managing system
packages for now, although there are plans to have more specialized PAC tools
for other uses as well.

Compared to Arch pacman or Void xbps, mpac is roughly equivalent to standalone
tar while mpkg is more like tar when used by either pacman or xbps. By design,
mpkg does not do some things often expected from a system package manager
in a Linux system, like searching package databases or downloading packages
or handling inter-package dependencies. Instead, it is a plumbing component
that could be used to build a tool similar to pacman, xbps or apt, written
with a different idea of how package metadata should be handled atop of that.


The PAC format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The custom format was designed as a simple alternative to tar.

PAC files have index at the start of the file, before any actual content
(as opposed to tar or cpio, which have file headers intermixed with content).
This allows listing files from a compressed package, and subsequently doing
checks that work at directory tree level (file conflicts and such) by only
decompressing a small chunk at the start of the file.

PAC does not store any file metadata beyond file type and size, with
only three supported file types: regular files, executables, and symlinks.
Within the package, the order of the files is also fixed.

Just like tar files, pacs are meant to be compressed whole. Also like tars,
pacs do not really support partial extraction well. The default assumption
is that if any of the files in a package are to be extracted, all of them
(or at least most of them) will be extracted.


Design and usage notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mpkg is designed with the assumption that the unit of consistency is a
repository, not a package, and that package metadata (descriptions,
dependency tree and so on) belongs to the repository as a whole instead
of being attached to individual packages. Consequently, PAC format has no
provisions for storing metadata within the package files.

The intended procedure is that the higher-level tool downloads and parses
repository index, figures out which packages it needs, downloads the packages,
and then uses mpkg to deploy them. This way, mpkg always works with a single
pac file and the higher-level tool handles inter-pac relations.

Another consequence of this assumption is very limited conflict checks that
mpkg performs, reporting only the names of the conflicting files but not the
packages they come from. The repository should be consistent and therefore no
two packages from the repository should be in conflict. If there are mutually
exclusive alternatives, those too should be marked in repository index and
not handled by mpkg. Cross-repository conflicts should be excluded using
package groups and different installation prefixes.

Whenever a single project provides several components that may be installed
independently, the project should be a repository and each component should
be a package. In general, packages should be split so that each is either
installed whole or not installed at all.

mpkg provides a way to silently skip directories from (a group of) packages
during installation. This feature was included primarily as a way of dealing
with locales and language-specific man pages, when multiple languages are
included with the package but the user may only want to install one or two
of those. It should be used as a last resort measure however; whenever
possible, optional language support should come in separate pacs, especially
when natural language support is provided externally to the project (i.e. not
by the same people who write the code), which is often the case.


Package groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Groups are intended to be used mostly for packages sharing common path prefix
of some sort. The idea is to keep namespaces separate when packages clearly
cannot be in conflict, and also to get rid of the common prefix in every single
package.

Planned use cases:

	* linux-firmware as a repository, with individual packages for each
	  blob or bunches of blobs that get installed together.
	  Common prefix would be /lib/firmware, and the package would not need
	  to carry it. As opposed to the Arch practice of installing 500MB
	  of blobs together even though a typical user needs less than 1MB
	  in most cases.

	* modules for python, and other languages with similar module structure.
	  Common prefix would be /lib/python-3.8 or whatever, and it would be
	  fine to use bare name of the module as the package name, without
	  prefixing it with python- like say Arch does.

	* shared libraries for a particular libc/ld combo.
	  Common prefix /lib/musl-x64, /lib/musl-arm, /lib/glibc-x64 without
	  name clashes between them, and without ugly Arch-style lib32-
	  prefixes. With minor effort, should allow installing shared library
	  packages for non-native architectures and using them with qemu, and
	  possibly handling Wine DLLs the same way (treating wine as an ld).

Package groups also provide a limited support for relocatable packages, but
that is more of an afterthough, and not a primary goal. Linux packages in
general must be assumed to be non-relocatable, and doing anything about that
is way beyond the scope of this project.


Package signing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hashes and signatures are metadata and such should be distributed separately
from the packages. In particular, with reproducible packages validated by
independent builds, attaching signatures to the PAC files is not a good idea.

# This should be obvious but I'm pretty sure there will be people asking why,
# in the year 2020+n, there is no support for attached signatures in a new
# package format, and complaining how grossly insecure mpkg therefore is.
