This directory contains a couple of services whose purpose is to handle
system-wide hotkeys. There are two currently: keymon that works on input
devices (keys on keyboard) and acpid which listens for ACPI events (power
button, lid switch etc on PCs).

Typical use for these is setting up system reboot on C-A-Del, VT switching
on C-A-Fx, soft power off, sleep on lid close and so on.

There is currently no special support for GPIO buttons, and it's not clear
whether there should be any. Current idea for GPIO is to use gpio_keys to
make them look like regular input devices, and then handle those events via
keymon.
