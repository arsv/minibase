.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-h\fR" 4
Copy here; destination is the current directory.
.IP "\fB-m\fR" 4
Move files instead of copying them.
.IP "\fB-n\fR" 4
Do not overwrite anything.
.IP "\fB-o\fR" 4
Copy over, silently overwriting existing files.
.IP "\fB-t\fR" 4
Copy to; destination directory is the first argument.
.IP "\fB-u\fR" 4
Transfer file ownership (uid/gid) to the copies.
.IP "\fB-q\fR" 4
Dry run, check for errors but do not copy anything.

'''
.SH NOTES
\fBcpy\fR never follows symlinks. A copy of symlink is a symlink with the same
contents. Other special files are silently ignored.
.P
Normally \fBcpy\fR performs a dry run to verify that there are no obvious
problems with the files being copied, and proceeds to copy any data only
if no issues are found. This may be changed with \fB-y\fR and \fB-q\fR.
