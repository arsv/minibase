.SH NAME
\fBlsusb\fR \- list USB devices
'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
The tool reads /sys/bus/usb/devices and produces a list of all non-hub USB
devices present in the system. For each device, two kinds of addresses are
shown: \fIbus\fB.\fIdev\fR (001.003) and
\fIhub\fR[\fB-\fIhub\fR]\fB-\fIport\fR (1-7 or 1-5-27). The kernel mostly
refers to devices using the hub-port scheme, but it some cases bus.dev shows
up as well.
.P
All USB devices also come with \fIvendor\fB:\fIproduct\fR pairs (1234:F0AB).
'''
.SH FILES
.IP "/sys/bus/usb/devices" 4
USB devices in sysfs.
'''
.SH NOTES
This tool does not use the USB id database to map vendor:product pairs to
human-readable names. Devices names shown are strings reported by the devices.
