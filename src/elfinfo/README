A tool for examining ELF files, similar to readelf.

This is mostly an internal use tool, written to provide whichever data
was needed during development, especially if said data was not readily
provided by GNU readelf. It is not meant to be complete, i.e. it does
not decode all possible data found in arbitrary ELF files, just the stuff
relevant to this project.
