This directory contains the top-level supervisor, aka pid 1,
aka system service or startup manager.

Bringing up a usable Linux system requires running some blocking
commands and then launching some services to run in background.

All svchub does is basically this:

    #!/bin/sh

    mount something
    mount something else

    /etc/svc/sysklogd &
    /etc/svc/service1 &
    /etc/svc/service2 &

    wait

..but more control over the spawned processes.
And without the need run a POSIX style shell.

With svchub, the script above becomes /base/etc/boot/startup:

    #!/base/bin/msh

    # blocking commands
    mount something
    mount something else

    # IPC calls to launch the services
    svcctl start sysklogd
    svcctl start service1
    svcctl start service2

    # startup script exits here

The spawned processes will keep running under svchub, with IPC available
to query their status, check their output, stop or restart them.

The early startup stuff has been moved to ../init instead.
