/* AP BSS code. Once the network (SSID) has been set up, we need to go
   through the scanlist and pick a station (BSSID) we'd like to use.
   This part is quite involved because we parse scanned IEs to check
   which stations support the encryption modes we want.

   In accordance with IEEE 802.11, this tool assumes that all APs
   sharing the same SSID are parts of the same network. When the user
   commands connection to a certain AP, this only means a fixed SSID.
   The supplicant is free to choose any BSSID advertising that SSID,
   and fall back to another one if connection fails. Limited roaming
   is possible as well. If connection is lost, the tool will try to
   re-connect to the same AP but failing that, attempts may be made
   with different APs of the same network.

   This assumption is quite important, half of the code below would
   not be there if we were targeting a fixed BSSID.

   At this moment, there is no support for fixed BSSID at all.
   The standard doesn't require it, and as far as I can tell, the few
   cases where it could be useful are much better served by ../temp/wifi
   instead. */

/* Note doing this in the client (for instance, supplying SSID and a set
   of BSSIDs the service should connect to) would not work if BSS'es are
   allowed to appear dynamically. Think of walking into a large building,
   connecting to the first AP visible, and then moving around the building
   while the supplicant roams between the stations installed in different
   locations within the building, and not reachable from the entrance.

   The above is a borderline case in practice, but 802.11 kind of impies
   this is the case we should be coding for. */

/* The code below is the only part of the in the supplicant itself that
   deals with IEs (Information Elements). IEs are normally parsed in the
   client.

   Ref. IEEE 802.11-2012 8.4.2 Information elements,
                         8.4.2.27 RSNE

   We also pick IEs to transmit here, which we will send with the ASSOCIATE
   command and later in EAPOL packet 3/4, confirming our choice of ciphers
   and auth scheme to the AP. */

   Parsing is done only when needed (that is, when we are choosing
   next AP to connect to) and results are kept specific to current
   struct ap settings. Most scan results, most of the time, do not
   get parsed because we're either idle or happily connected.

   (or does so in-between our scans), we clear some of the flags
