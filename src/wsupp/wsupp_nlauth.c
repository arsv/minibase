/* Wi-Fi authentication state machine. Assuming all the parameters
   have been set in struct ap, this module performs a single connection
   attempt to a single BSS.

   For most PC cards, the typical command sequence is

	<- NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE      trigger_authentication
	-> NL80211_CMD_AUTHENTICATE      nlm_authenticate
	<- NL80211_CMD_ASSOCIATE         trigger_associaction
	-> NL80211_CMD_ASSOCIATE         nlm_associate
	-> NL80211_CMD_CONNECT           nlm_connect

   followed by EAPOL exchange and then normal traffic.
   Some drivers/devices merge AUTHENTICATE and ASSOCIATE into a single
   CONNECT command:

	<- NL80211_CMD_CONNECT           trigger_connect
	-> NL80211_CMD_CONNECT           nlm_connect

   There are also drivers/devices capable of doing EAPOL exchange, those
   aren't supported here at all. Those use CONNECT to carry the PSK among
   other parameters, and consequently do not need EAPOL to be triggered
   after connection.

   Which sequence should be used gets detected in init_netlink().

   Side note, sending CONNECT to a driver that need AUTH/ASSOC results in
   no errors and no connection either, just like non-connected DISCONNECT
   described below. APsel code should time us out if this happens.

   The point of the code here is mostly managing the sequences above,
   so that the AP module can just start_connection() and then just
   wait until connection_ready() or connection_end() gets called. */

/* Quick note regarding disconnects. The full sequence there is just

	<- NL80211_CMD_DISCONNECT        trigger_disconnect
	-> NL80211_CMD_DISCONNECT        nlm_disconnect

   but it only happen with user-commanded disconnects.
   Most of the time, the notification is spontaneous because disconnect
   was initiated by the device (or indirectly, by the AP):

	-> NL80211_CMD_DISCONNECT        nlm_disconnect

   Worse yet, drivers absolute love ignoring this command when there's
   no active connection:

	<- NL80211_CMD_DISCONNECT        trigger_disconnect
	   ...
	   (crickets)

   This is a big issue becase not completing AUTHENTICATE/ASSOCIATE
   sequence properly *may* leave the card in a semi-connected state,
   where it's not really connected but replies -EALREADY to incoming
   AUTHENTICATE commands.

   There is no reliable way to know whether DISCONNECT would work
   until we get CONNECT notification. Before that, it's racy.
   We handle this the same way mainline wpa_supplicant does, namely
   but not attepting to disconnect AUTHENTICATEd or ASSOCIATEd
   connections. Instead, if we catch -EALREADY from AUTHENTICATE,
   we try to disconnect, and then repeat AUTHENTICATE command again.

   This AUTH-DISCONNECT-AUTH is handled by the state machine here,
   but timed externally by the apsel code (which handles all timing
   anyway). */

/* Note there is one more AUTH-x-AUTH sequence that needs to be handled.
   AUTH may return -ENOENT in case BSS is not in the card's scan cache
   even though the AP is still in range. This is quite common actually,
   cards tend to drop scan results 10 to 20 seconds after the scan and
   we retain scans[] much longer than that.

   The solution is simple, just run a quick single-frequency scan to refresh
   the scan entry in the card's cache. However, since this sequence involves
   a scan, it is not handled here. We just call connection_ended(-ENOENT)
   and let the apsel code handle it. */
