.SH NAME
\fBmpkg\fR \- system package manager for packages in PAC format
'''
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmpkg\fR \fBdeploy\fR [\fI/root\fR] [\fIgroup\fB:\fR]\fIname\fR \
\fIpackage.pac\fR
.P
\fBmpkg\fR \fBremove\fR [\fI/root\fR] [\fIgroup\fB:\fR]\fIname\fR
.P

'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmpkg\fR is a specialized tool for unpacking PAC archives onto the local
filesystem in a way that can be undone, and removing unpacked files later.
To achive that, \fBmpkg deploy\fR saves a list of files about to be unpacked
in a pre-defined location, which both \fBmpkg remove\fR and \fBmpkg list\fR
use later.
'''
.SH CONFIGURATION
While deploying, \fBmpkg\fR checks that the package being deployed follows
local policy, in that the files are only deploy to allowed locations.
.P
The configuration is specified in \fBmpkg.conf\fR:
.P
.ni
    # Lines starting with / denote allowed directory
    /bin
    /lib/foo

    # Lines starting with - instruct mpkg to skip specified directories
    -lib/bar

    # The stuff above applies to packages not in any group.
    # The stuff after the following line applies to group "opt" only
    @opt
    /opt

    # Groups may have a common prefix defined. For this group, package
    # entry "bin/foo" will be deployed as "/base/bin/foo", and actual
    # deployment will always be limited to /base/bin and /base/man.
    @base
    =base
    /bin
    /man
.fi
.P
Paths that are neither allowed nor skipped are disallowed. \fBmpkg\fR will
refuse to deploy a package containing disallowed paths.
