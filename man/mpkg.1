.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmpkg\fR is a specialized tool for unpacking PAC archives onto the local
filesystem in a way that can be undone. To achive that, \fBmpkg deploy\fR
saves a list of files about to be unpacked in a pre-defined location,
which both \fBmpkg remove\fR and \fBmpkg list\fR use later.
'''
.SH CONFIGURATION
While deploying, \fBmpkg\fR checks that the package being deployed follows
local policy, in that the files are only deploy to allowed locations.
.P
.ni
    # Source directory
    from /var/cache/packages
    # Installation prefix
    into /
    # Paths within the package to install or skip
    pass bin
    pass lib
    skip man

    # Different package group, packages here would be named opt:name
    group opt
    from /var/cache/packages/opt
    into /opt
    # pass everything
.fi
.P
Paths that are neither allowed nor skipped are disallowed.
\fBmpkg\fR will refuse to deploy a package containing disallowed paths.
