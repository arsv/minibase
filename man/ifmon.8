.SH NAME
\fBifmon\fR \- network interface monitor
'''
.SH DESCRIPTION
Network interfaces in Linux are not static and cannot be reliably configured
during system startup. \fBifmon\fR addresses this problem by monitoring kernel
events and spawning scripts to configure interfaces once they appear in the
system. Together with its client tool, \fBifctl\fR, it also maintains stable
mapping between identifiable physical devices and their assigned setup scripts,
regardless of non-persistent interface names the kernel uses.
.P
Whenever a new interface appears, say \fIeth1\fR, ifmon spawns
.P
.nf
	/etc/net/identify \fIeth1\fR
.fi
.P
which should attempt to identify the physical device behind \fIeth1\fR
and its assigned profile. This is typically done by running
.P
.nf
	\fBifctl \fIeth1 \fBidentify\fR
.fi
.P
which then passes profile name back to ifmon. For any device that has
been successfully identified and assigned a profile, ifmon then runs
.P
.nf
	/etc/net/mode-\fIprofile\fR
.fi
.P
to configure the device.
