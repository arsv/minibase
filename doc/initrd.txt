Booting with initrd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Initrd (initramfs) is a small filesystem image that gets loaded alongside the
kernel (or as a part of the kernel) into the RAM by the bootloader. Since it
is already in RAM by the time the kernel starts, the code needed to mount it
is very simple, unconditional and device-independent.

With initrd, the task of locating and mounting the real root filesystem gets
moved to the userspace, resulting in less awful kernel space code and much
more flexibility in implementing device-locating logic.

Indications for using initrd:

	* modular kernel, with modules either for the device containing
	  the real root, or the filesystem used there

	* device containing the real root is identified by something other
	  than a fixed major:minor pair

	* something needs to be done prior to mounting the real root
	  (fsck, encryption, device mapper setup etc)

Realistically, with current Linux, only some SoC-based systems can safely get
away without initrd. For anything else, in particular anything PC-like, initrd
is pretty much unavoidable.

This project provides several tools designed specifically for use in initrd.

# Technical note: modern Linux systems use initramfs, with initrd proper
# considered outdated, and this project only really supports initramfs.
# However, the distinction is not really important outside of the kernel,
# so in this file, "initrd" is used to refer to either.


Startup script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# NOTE: somewhat outdated after devinit changes, to be re-written.

The kernel "mounts" initrd as filesystem root and spawns a single process,
execing /linuxrc as pid 1. Typical contents:

    #!/bin/msh

    # mount required virtual filesystems
    run /bin/mount -vc /dev /sys /proc

    # wait for devices, see below
    run /bin/devinit -i # creates /dev/mapper/root

    # mount the real root filesystem
    run /bin/kmount /root /dev/mapper/root

    # transition to the real root
    exec /bin/switchroot /root /etc/boot/start

The overall goal of this script is simply to get the real root mounted
somewhere, and then call switchroot to that directory.


Locating the root device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are essentially three problems to solve at this stage:

    * load driver modules for the storage device and the bus it's on;
    * wait for the device to be initialized;
    * figure out which /dev node corresponds to the right device.

The tools that address them are `devinit` and `findblk`. The role of devinit
is to handle kernel-initiated module loading requests, which is normally done
by udev service (`udevmod` here). Unlike the service, `devinit` does not need
to run indefinitely. Instead, it spawns a script, /etc/devinit, and does its
thing only until the script exits.

The script runs with udev events being handled in the background. Its role is
to wait until the right device appears in /dev.
Typical contents of /etc/devinit:

    #!/bin/msh

    run /bin/findblk mbr:00112233 1:boot 2:root

See man pages for `devinit` and `findblk` for detailed description.
To work properly, `devinit` needs one more script, /etc/modpipe:

    #!/bin/msh

    exec /bin/modprobe -ip

See modprobe man page on what it does.


Statically-located root devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In case the kernel is modular but the list of modules to load is known ahead
of time, `devinit` should be skipped, and both `modprobe` and `findblk` should
be called directly from /init:

    #!/bin/msh

    run /bin/kmount -vc /dev /sys /proc

    run /bin/modprobe -i some-mmc-controller

    run /bin/findblk name:mmcblk0 p1:root

    run /bin/kmount /root /dev/mapper/root

    exec /bin/switchroot /root /etc/boot/start

The reason to use `findblk` in the example above is to pause the script
until /dev/mmcblk0 appears, since modprobe does not wait for the module
to initialize. In simpler cases, it can be replaced with `waitfor` msh
built-in.

If the name of the device node is static, and it does not require waiting,
`findblk` stage can be skipped as well:

    #!/bin/msh

    run /bin/kmount -vc /dev /sys /proc

    run /bin/kmount /root /dev/mmcblk0p1

    exec /bin/switchroot /root /etc/boot/start

At this point, the need to use initrd in the first place should be questioned.


Encrypted rootfs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Encryption layer must be setup up before mounting the file system.
Sample /etc/devinit using `passblk`:

    #!/bin/msh

    run /bin/findblk mbr:00112233 1:root

    run /bin/passblk /etc/keyfile root

See `passblk` man page for a detailed description. The end result, again, will
be a mountable partition pointed to by /dev/mapper/root.

Running `passblk` from devinit given the kernel a chance to request encryption
support modules if those aren't loaded. Alternatively, the module can be loaded
statically in /init, and `findblk` can be called there as well:

    #!/bin/msh

    run /bin/kmount -vc /dev /sys /proc

    run /bin/modprobe -i crypto_engine
    run /bin/modprobe -i crypto_user
    run /bin/modprobe -i cryptd
    run /bin/modprobe -i cbc
    run /bin/modprobe -i ecb
    run /bin/modprobe -i xts
    run /bin/modprobe -i dm-crypt

    run /bin/devinit -i

    run /bin/passblk /etc/keyfile root

    run /bin/kmount /root /dev/mapper/root

    exec /bin/switchroot /root /etc/boot/start

Depending on configuration, some modules may need to be loaded statically even
if `passblk` gets called from /etc/devinit.


Entering to the real root
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once the root partition is mounted, /init should exec into `switchroot`,
which will subsequently exec into the next stage, which in the examples above
is `/etc/boot/start`. Not much else to discuss here, check the man page for
`switchroot` for a detailed description of what exactly it does.

This is the one of the few points outside of the kernel where the distinction
between initrd proper and initramfs matters. `switchroot` only works with
initramfs. Switching from initrd proper requires a different tool that would
perform a different syscall sequence. There is no such tool in this project
at this moment. Initrd proper (as in, initial ramdisk) is generally considered
deprecated in favor of initramfs.


Virtual and non-root filesystems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is up to the system builder to decide whether to mount particular virtual
filesystems in initrd, or delay it to the real root startup script. There are
several that need to be mounted early: /dev, /sys and possibly /proc. This
depends solely on the tools used in initrd. For instance, `findblk` needs both
/dev and /sys to work.

In case separate partitions are used for /var or some other directories,
those probably should be located and possibly mounted from initrd as well.
This mostly depends on the convenience of running devinit (and/or findblk)
from the real root.

`switchroot` will attempt to preserve any mount points when switching from
the virtual initramfs root to the real filesystem. Check the man page on how
it does so.


Which modules to put into initrd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ideally, only modules needed to mount the rootfs should be put into initrd.
Anything that could remain in the real rootfs, should remain there.
In particular, avoid DRM modules unless absolutely necessary (i.e. graphical
passphrase prompt or something like that), those tend to be quite large.

Use `depmod` to re-build dependency index and verify that no dependencies
are missing. Avoid using the full index from the real rootfs; it will work,
but will take more time than necessary to parse.


Modules and compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are essentially two ways of compressing initrd:

	* compress the whole image
	* compress individual modules

Compressing the whole image results in the best ratio, but forces complete
decompression early during kernel startup. Compressing modules individually
and leaving the image uncompressed results in subpar compression ratios, but
allows only the modules in actual use to be decompressed.

Whole-image compression should therefore be preferred for cases where most of
the initrd contents will be used, whereas individually compressed modules are
better when initrd has to carry lots of modules but only few are expected to
get loaded. The latter is often the case for generic PC distributions.

Avoid dual compression (compressed image with individually compressed modules),
it serves no purpose and slows down module loading. If the whole image gets
compressed, leave everything inside uncompressed.


Initrd filesystem layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This projects supports two distinct layouts for initrd: full and simplified.

The full layout means initrd paths as the same as they would be on the real
rootfs. In particular, as far as this project is concerned,

    * config files are in /base/etc, and
    * kernel modules are in /lib/modules/$REVISION

This kind of layout allows using abritrary tools from rootfs, unchanged, in
initrd context. However, in many cases that's not important, and the extra
directories serve no purpose in the restricted initrd environment.

Simplified layout is meant to addrees this concern:

    * all config files are in /etc
    * kernel modules are in /lib/modules (no $REVISION!)

A couple of tools from this project, modprobe and devinit, that would otherwise
try to access /base/etc, accept command line option -i to use the simplified
layout. Check respective manual pages for exact paths. Several other tools,
like msh and findblk, do not use /base paths, or do not use abosolute paths
at all, and can be used in initrd environment at is.
