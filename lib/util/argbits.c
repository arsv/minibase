/* Most tools in minibase are ok with first-argument-only squashed options,
   as in

	mount -re blah ...

   but not

	mount -r -e blah ...

   The assuption is that the options never take arguments of its own, just
   change how the tool treats the remaining arguments.

   Allowing -opt stuff as the first argument only also simplifies subsequent
   argument quoting; it is ok to pass - as that first arguments and the rest
   won't be checked for leading - anyway.

   The "key" here is a string like "abc". Given -ac for arg, the function
   returns an int with bits 0 (index of a in key) and 2 (index of c) set. */
